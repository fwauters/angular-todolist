# Angular Todolist

:construction: **This project is a work in progress !** :construction:

:construction: **This app isn't hosted yet !** :construction:

## Concept

Initially I wanted to make an application that allows users to create their own databases. But having never worked with Angular before, I chose to start with a personal todolist app to learn how it works.

## Content

This is a personal todolist-app with a user session system. You can register (don't worry, your password is hashed with [bcyptjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs)) and build your own todolist. Everything is saved in Firestore so you can logout/login as you please.

## Context

I made this app to learn to work with Angular and TypeScript in preparation for my internship.

### Tech

- HTML / CSS
- Node JS
- Angular / TypeScript
- Cloud Firestore
